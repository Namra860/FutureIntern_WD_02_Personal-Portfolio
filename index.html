            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a passionate and dedicated aspiring software engineer currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from DAVV University. With a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, I am eager to embark on a career in software development.

                I have honed my skills in Java, SQL, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which I believe are crucial for building efficient and scalable software solutions. My educational journey has fueled my passion for technology, and I am committed to continuous learning and growth in this ever-evolving field.
                
                As a fresher, I am excited to bring my enthusiasm, strong work ethic, and problem-solving abilities to real-world challenges. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and work with like-minded professionals who share my passion for technology and development.
